# RipplePlan
A calendar and to-do list web application in one. Promote personal production by writing down what you have to do today. 

This project uses the Flask framework to connect the Python backend to the HTML, CSS, and Javascript front end. The to-do list is a simple add and
delete list. The calendar shows the current date: month, day, and year.
